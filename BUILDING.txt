Reform should build on any platform which supports GHC 6.2 (i.e. Win32 or
Posix). GHC versions prior to 6.2 will almost work, except that showHex
will prepend "0x" to hexadecimal numbers, which uglifies the output a bit.

On UNIX platforms you'll probably want to delete the ".exe" from the first
line of the Makefile.
